    bio: >
      Yoshua Bengio is recognized as one of the world's artificial intelligence leaders and a pioneer of deep learning.
      Professor since 1993 at the Université de Montréal, he received the A.M. Turing Award 2018, considered like the Nobel prize for computing, with Geoff Hinton and Yann LeCun.
      Holder of the Canada Research Chair in Statistical Learning Algorithms, he is also the founder and scientific director of Mila, the Quebec Institute of AI--the world's biggest university-based research group in deep learning.
      In 2019, he earned the prestigious Killam Prize from the Canada Council for the Arts.
      Concerned about the social impact of AI, he actively contributed to the Montreal Declaration for the Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence.

    affiliation: Carnegie Mellon University
    picture: img/mitchell.jpg
    bio: >
      Tom M. Mitchell is the Founders University Professor at Carnegie Mellon University, where he founded the world's first Machine Learning Department.
      His research involves machine learning approaches to natural language understanding, and uses brain imaging to study
      how the human brain understands language.  He believes conversational machine learning will be the most significant
      new thrust in machine learning over the coming decade.  Mitchell is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering,
      a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Fellow and Past President of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).
      He is interested in societal impacts of computer science, recently co-chaired a U.S. National Academies study on
      “Information Technology, Automation, and the Workforce,” and has recently testified to several Congressional
      forums on the impacts of AI on society.
  - name: Evelina Fedorenko

    affiliation: MIT
    picture: img/fedorenko.jpg
    bio: >
      Ev Fedorenko is a cognitive neuroscientist who specializes in the study of the human language system.
      She received her Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and Linguistics from Harvard University in 2002.
      She then proceeded to pursue graduate studies in cognitive science and neuroscience at MIT.
      After receiving her Ph.D. in 2007, she was awarded a K99R00 career development award from NICHD
      and stayed on as a postdoctoral researcher and then a research scientist at MIT.
      In 2014, she joined the faculty at HMS/MGH, and in 2019 she moved back to MIT joining the faculty
      in the Brain and Cognitive Sciences Department and the McGovern Institute for Brain Research.
      Fedorenko aims to understand the computations we perform and the representations we build during
      language processing, and to provide a detailed characterization of the brain regions underlying
      these computations and representations. She uses an array of methods, including fMRI, ERPs, MEG,
      intracranial recordings and stimulation, and tools from Natural Language Processing, and works
      with diverse populations, including healthy adults and children, as well as individuals with
      developmental and acquired brain disorders.
  - name: Gary Marcus

    affiliation: New York University and Robust.AI
    picture: img/marcus.jpg
    bio: >
      Gary Marcus is a scientist, best-selling author, and entrepreneur. He is Founder and CEO of Robust.AI, 
      and was Founder and CEO of Geometric Intelligence, a machine learning company acquired by Uber in 2016. 
      His work on infant rule learning and children's overregularizations have been central in debates about 
      computational models of human cognition for nearly three decades. 
      He is also the author of five books, including The Algebraic Mind, Kluge, The Birth of the Mind, and 
      The New York Times best seller Guitar Zero, as well as his latest, co-authored with Ernest Davis, 
      Rebooting AI: Building Machines We Can Trust.  And you can catch him again on December 23 
      at his upcoming debate with Yoshua Bengio. 
      Today is the world debut of his new benchmark.
