# Context and Compositionality in Biological and Artificial Neural Systems
#### [NeurIPS 2019](https://neurips.cc) Workshop, Vancouver, Canada
##### December 2019

## Call for Papers
Submit at: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CNTXTCOMP2019/](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CNTXTCOMP2019/)

We will consider the following (non-exhaustive) list of topics for contribution:
- Contextual sequence processing in the human brain
- Compositional representations in the human brain
- Systematic generalization in deep learning
- Compositionality in human intelligence
- Compositionality in natural language
- Understanding composition and temporal processing in neural network models
- New approaches to compositionality and temporal processing in language
- Hierarchical representations of temporal information
- Datasets for contextual sequence processing
- Applications of compositional neural networks to real-world problems

**Formatting Instructions:**  All submissions must be in PDF format. Submissions are limited to four content pages, including all figures and tables; additional pages containing only references are allowed. You must format your submission using the [NeurIPS 2019 LaTeX style file](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2019/PaperInformation/StyleFiles). Submissions that violate the NeurIPS style (e.g., by decreasing margins or font sizes) or page limits may be rejected without further review. All submissions should be anonymous.

Accepted papers will be presented during a poster session, with spotlight oral presentations for exceptional submissions. The accepted papers will be made publicly available as non-archival reports, allowing future submissions to archival conferences or journals.

The review process is double-blind. We also welcome published papers that are within the scope of the workshop (without re-formatting, if the paper is already 4 pages or shorter). Already-published papers do not have to be anonymous. They are eligible for poster sessions and will only have a very light review process.
